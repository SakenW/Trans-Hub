# **Trans-Hub Document Library**

Welcome to the official documentation repository of `Trans-Hub`. This repository aims to provide clear, accurate, and easily accessible information for different types of readersâ€”whether they are first-time users, developers looking to contribute code, or core maintainers of the project.

## **Document Structure and Design Philosophy**

Our document library is organized according to the design principles of **audience and purpose**. This means that each directory and file has its specific target audience and content scope, minimizing information overlap and ensuring a 'single source of truth'.

It seems there is no text provided for translation. Please provide the text you would like to have translated.

## **Runnable Examples**

We believe that 'code is the best documentation.' In the `/examples` directory, we provide a series of fully runnable Python scripts with detailed comments, designed to intuitively showcase the core features and best practices of `Trans-Hub`.

- **[Basic Usage (`01_basic_usage.py`)](../examples/01_basic_usage.py)**: The best starting point for a quick introduction, demonstrating the core request-processing-caching flow.
- **[Real World Simulation (`02_real_world_simulation.py`)](../examples/02_real_world_simulation.py)**: The ultimate demonstration showcasing all advanced features of `Trans-Hub` in a complex concurrent environment.
- **[Specific Use Case: Translating `.strings` Files (`03_specific_use_case_strings_file.py`)](../examples/03_specific_use_case_strings_file.py)**: Demonstrates how to integrate `Trans-Hub` into a specific localization workflow.

Before diving into the detailed guide, we strongly recommend that you run these examples yourself first.

## **Document Writing Standards**

To maintain the consistency and high quality of the document library, all future document writing should adhere to the following principles:

1. **Follow the established structure**: New documents should be placed in one of the four directories above based on their content and target audience.  
2. **Maintain a single source of truth**: Definitions of APIs and architectures should always be located in the `/api` and `/architecture` directories. Other documents should **link** to them instead of duplicating content.  
3. **Provide runnable examples**: Code examples provided in `/guides` should be as complete and directly runnable as possible.  
4. **Update the changelog**: Significant changes to code or documentation should be recorded in the `CHANGELOG.md` in the project root directory.
